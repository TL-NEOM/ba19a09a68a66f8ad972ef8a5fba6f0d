# Meetings need a **PURPOSE** and an **OBJECTIVE**.  

The main difference between a meeting **purpose** and a meeting **objective** is that:
- the **Purpose** is the reason why youâ€™re having a meeting, 
- the **Objective** is the desired outcome of the meeting.

The meeting **Purpose** is:  
  - The cause of your meeting that brings everyone together
  - A bit abstract and not measurable:
    - it's the driving idea behind the meeting, 
    - not the concrete goals to accomplish

The meeting **Objective** is:  
  - a set of specific goals that you want to achieve:
    - Examples:
      - make a decision about launch date, 
      - come up with 3 team OKRs for the next quarter, 
      - review and gather input on latest landing page designs
  - Measurable and concrete - these objectives will guide the meeting agenda and action items

_**Remember:** you need both a Purpose and Objective to have an effective meeting! And you can combine these into a **"meeting goal"** if you find that simpler. See example below_

## **Example**  
> **Meeting Purpose:** _To narrow down the list of qualified candidates for the open account manager position._  
> **Meeting Objectives:**  _Choose the top three candidates to reach out for a second interview._  

_**OR**_

> **Meeting Goal (Purpose and Objective combined):**  _Interview for the open account manager position, narrowing down list of qualified candidates to top three (3) for second interview._
