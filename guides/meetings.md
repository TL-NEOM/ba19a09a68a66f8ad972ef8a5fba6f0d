## Example Meeting Notes
### Purpose
Decide whether to renew our PR agency contract for another year

### Scribe: Allison Brown

### Agenda:
- Review agency results to date (actual vs. goal)
    - Media mentions = 29 (Goal was 50)
    - Tier 1 article placements = 1 (Goal was 5)
- Discuss pros & cons of renewing
    - **Pros**
        -  The work really hard even if the results are lackluster
        -  They already know our company, value prop, etc
    - **Cons**
        -  Results, even if improved, are unlikely to change substantially
        -  Agency has large proportion of junior members
        -  We often have to follow up repeatedly to make sure work gets done
- **Decision:**
    - Renew for 1 month to finish current initiatives (Darren)
    - Ask network for PR agency referrals for new agency (Rob & Darren)

# Meeting Cheat Sheet

Core Values
  1. Meeting scarcity over meeting abundance.
  2. Thoughtful scheduling over broad invitations.
  3. Active discussion over mind-numbing presentation.
  4. Freely sharing over knowledge silos.

Scheduling Meetings
- Invite fewer people whenever possible
- Build meeting clusters by scheduling meetings near other meetings
- Avoid marathon meetings (1 hour max)

Conducting Meetings
- Active discussion > passive presentation
- If you shouldn’t be there, leave the meeting
- Every task gets a DRI (directly responsible individual)
- Follow up by sharing notes within 24 hours
- No distracting technology used for non-meeting activities (phones, laptops, etc.)

# The P.A.N.T.S Test

### &EmptySmallSquare; <u>P</u>urpose  
- Is it clear what must be accomplished for the meeting to be a success?  
- Is the purpose of the meeting in the calendar invite?  

### &EmptySmallSquare; <u>A</u>genda  
- Is the agenda (or a link to the agenda) in the calendar invite?  

### &EmptySmallSquare; <u>N</u>otes  
- Have you created your notes by filling in your agenda with additional information?  
- Are all decisions noted and highlighted or underlined?  
- If you have a new document for notes, is it shared or linked in the calendar invite?  

### &EmptySmallSquare; <u>T</u>asks  
- Are all next steps listed at the bottom of your notes?  
- Are all tasks assigned to a DRI (directly responsible individual)?  

### &EmptySmallSquare; <u>S</u>hared  
- Have you shared your notes with all attendees?  
- Have you shared your notes with others in your organization who can benefit (via email, Slack, etc.)?

# Meetings need a **PURPOSE** and an **OBJECTIVE**.  

The main difference between a meeting **purpose** and a meeting **objective** is that:
- the **Purpose** is the reason why you’re having a meeting, 
- the **Objective** is the desired outcome of the meeting.

The meeting **Purpose** is:  
  - The cause of your meeting that brings everyone together
  - A bit abstract and not measurable:
    - it's the driving idea behind the meeting, 
    - not the concrete goals to accomplish

The meeting **Objective** is:  
  - a set of specific goals that you want to achieve:
    - Examples:
      - make a decision about launch date, 
      - come up with 3 team OKRs for the next quarter, 
      - review and gather input on latest landing page designs
  - Measurable and concrete - these objectives will guide the meeting agenda and action items

_**Remember:** you need both a Purpose and Objective to have an effective meeting! And you can combine these into a **"meeting goal"** if you find that simpler. See example below_

## **Example**  
> **Meeting Purpose:** _To narrow down the list of qualified candidates for the open account manager position._  
> **Meeting Objectives:**  _Choose the top three candidates to reach out for a second interview._  

_**OR**_

> **Meeting Goal (Purpose and Objective combined):**  _Interview for the open account manager position, narrowing down list of qualified candidates to top three (3) for second interview._

## Meeting with **PURPOSE** = less meetings!

The **"secret sauce"**?  
- **<span style="color:red;">NO Agenda/Purpose?</span> = <span style="color:red;">&#10007; NO MEETING!</span>**  
- **<span style="color:red;">NO Objective?</span> = <span style="color:red;">&#10007; NO MEETING!</span>**  
- <span style="color:green;">It's okay to cancel recurring meetings when they no longer serve a purpose (excluding 1:1s)</span>
