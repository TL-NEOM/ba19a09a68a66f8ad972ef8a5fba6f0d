# Meetings P.A.N.T.S Framework
Meetings need a Purpose and an Objective.  

The main difference between a meeting purpose and a meeting objective is that:
- the meeting purpose is the reason why you’re having a meeting, 
- the objective is the desired outcome of the meeting.

A meeting purpose is:  
  - The cause of your meeting that brings everyone together
  - A bit abstract and not measurable:
    - it's the driving idea behind the meeting, 
    - not the concrete goals to accomplish

Meeting objectives are:  
  - Specific goals that you want to achieve:
    - Examples:
      - make a decision about launch date, 
      - come up with 3 team OKRs for the next quarter, 
      - review and gather input on latest landing page designs
  - Measurable and concrete - these objectives will guide the meeting agenda and action items

_**Remember:** you need both a purpose and objectives to have an effective meeting! And you can combine these into a **"meeting goal"** if you find that simpler. See example below_

## Example  
**Meeting Purpose:** To narrow down the list of qualified candidates for the open account manager position.  
**Meeting Objectives:**  Choose the top three candidates to reach out for a second interview.  
*OR*  
**Meeting Goal (Purpose and Objective combined):** Interview for the open account manager position, narrowing down list of qualified candidates to top three (3) for second interview.

## Meeting with **PURPOSE** = less meetings!

The **"secret sauce"**?  
- **No agenda/purpose? = NO MEETING!**  
- **No objective? = NO MEETING!**  
- It's okay to cancel recurring meetings when they no longer serve a purpose (excluding 1:1s)  

***

Most meetings fit into 6 categories:
1. Status updates (pointless)
2. Information sharing (use Slack)
3. Decision making (often necessary)
4. Problem solving (often necessary)
5. Innovation (useful)
6. Team building (useful)

To ensure efficiency and being respectful of attendees time:
- Cut 1-2,  
- Manage 3-4, and  
- Prioritize 5-6
