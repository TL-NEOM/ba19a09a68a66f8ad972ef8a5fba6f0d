# Meetings P.A.N.T.S Framework
Meetings need a Purpose and an Objective.  

The main difference between a meeting purpose and a meeting objective is that:
- the meeting purpose is the reason why you’re having a meeting, 
- the objective is the desired outcome of the meeting.

A meeting purpose is:  
  - The cause of your meeting that brings everyone together
  - A bit abstract and not measurable:
    - it's the driving idea behind the meeting, 
    - not the concrete goals to accomplish

Meeting objectives are:  
  - Specific goals that you want to achieve:
    - Examples:
      - make a decision about launch date, 
      - come up with 3 team OKRs for the next quarter, 
      - review and gather input on latest landing page designs
  - Measurable and concrete - these objectives will guide the meeting agenda and action items

_**Remember:** you need both a purpose and objectives to have an effective meeting! And you can combine these into a **"meeting goal"** if you find that simpler._


## Meeting with **PURPOSE** = less meetings!

The **"secret sauce"**?  
- **No agenda/purpose? = NO MEETING!**  
- **No objective? = NO MEETING!**  
- It's okay to cancel recurring meetings when they no longer serve a purpose (excluding 1:1s)
